# to

A CLI utility for bookmarking directories with tab completion.

This is a [Rust] implementation of the excellent shell script [autochthe/to]. I ([jxson]) created this utility as a way to learn the [Rust programming language][Rust] and hopefully provide a stable cross-platform experience.

# Stability: Experimental

This code is under active development.

Expect the unexpected. Please provide feedback on api and your use-case.
